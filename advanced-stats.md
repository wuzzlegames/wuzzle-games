## Implementation Notes

### Data Storage
- All statistics should be calculated from existing game completion data
- Store aggregated stats in Firebase for quick retrieval
- Recalculate stats on-demand
- Maintain historical data for trend analysis
- Stats like per month etc should take into account different years - meaning show cumulative and have option to view year wise.

### Display Format
- Use charts/graphs for distributions and trends
- Show percentages and counts
- Provide date ranges for historical views
- Allow filtering by time period (week, month, year, all-time)

### Privacy
- All stats are private to the user
- No leaderboard integration for advanced stats
- Users can opt to share specific stats if desired

### Performance
- Calculate stats asynchronously to avoid blocking UI

- **Letter frequency analysis**: Most/least used starting letters
- **Pattern recognition**: Common guess patterns you use
- **Comparison with global averages**: How you compare to all players
- **Predictive analytics**: Estimated performance for upcoming games
- **Achievement tracking**: Badges for statistical milestones
